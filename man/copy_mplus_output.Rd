\title{A Function to Copy the Data Folder}
\usage{
copy_mplus_output(source_main_dir, dest_main_dir, output_folder)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_main_dir}{It is a main directory, where the study condition folders,
including data files, are located. This main directory is to be copied.}

\item{dest_main_dir}{It is a main destination directory, where the study
condition folders, including data files, will be located.}

\item{output_folder}{This is the folder where the output files
(".out", ".dat") are stored. The folder represents an estimator.}
}
\description{
In a data folder, there are sub folders, which represent study conditions.
In the sub folders, there may be folders for estimators. This function allows
one to copy just the output files with the extensions "out" and "dat"
and paste another location but preserving the folder structure.
It uses the "folder.Rdata" (study condition folders), which are created in
a data generation stage.
}
\examples{
library(AUTTT)

source_main_dir <- "C:/Users/shh6304/Desktop/test3"
# dest_main_dir does not exist and will be created.
# Folders and files in "test3" will be cloned.
dest_main_dir <- "C:/Users/shh6304/OneDrive - Western Michigan University/test3"

copy_mplus_output(source_main_dir = "C:/Users/shh6304/Desktop/test3",
                 dest_main_dir = "C:/Users/shh6304/OneDrive - Western Michigan University/test3",
                 output_folder = "ML_probit")
